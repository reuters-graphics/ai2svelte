You can now export your ai2svelte settings as Profiles, allowing you to save and load different configurations for various projects or workflows. This feature is particularly useful when working on multiple projects with distinct requirements, as it enables you to quickly switch between settings without manually adjusting each option.

Furthermore, Profiles can be shared with team members or across different machines, ensuring consistency in export settings and streamlining collaboration. To share your local Profiles with others, open up `Settings` tab, click on `Save Profile` and select `Export my profiles`. This will generate `profiles.json` file that you can share with others.

To load Profiles shared by others, open up `Settings` tab and click on `Load Profile` button and select `Import from file` option. This saves all the external profiles in your local storage for future use. You can now select `Load Profile` dropdown to load any of the saved profiles.

The extension comes loaded with a default profile named `default` that contains the recommended settings for most use-cases. To modify your default profile, simply load it from the `Load Profile` dropdown, make your desired changes in the settings, and then save it back using the `Save Profile` button.

Any subsequent calls to `Reset Config` will now reset the settings to those defined in your `default` profile, rather than the factory settings. This allows you to maintain your preferred default configuration while still having the option to revert to it easily.
