The new ai2svelte plugin is a total overhaul of the previous version, with a focus on improving the user experience and expanding the range of features available. Some of the key improvements include:

- Upgrade from the script to a UI based visual format
- A wider variety of pre-defined shadows and animations to choose from
- Layer order follows the stacking context of the elements in Adobe Illustrator
- SVG layers are now trimmed to it's own size rather than the entire artboard
- Introducing Snippets
