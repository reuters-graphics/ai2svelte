The ai2svelte plugin comes with sensible default settings optimized for most workflows. However, you can easily customize these settings through the plugin's **Home** tab to better suit your specific needs and project requirements.

### Adding/Removing properties

<Steps>
  1. Open the `Home` tab in the ai2svelte panel. {/* prettier-ignore */}
  2. Switch from `UI` to `Code` format view. {/* prettier-ignore */}
  3. Add your new property as a key-value pair in YAML format.
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
</Steps>

The code editor provides helpful features to streamline property management, including syntax highlighting and intelligent value suggestions to ensure proper configuration.

### Restoring Default Settings

To restore all ai2svelte settings to their factory defaults, navigate to the `Settings` tab and click the `Reset Config` button. This will revert all custom configurations back to the original optimized values.
