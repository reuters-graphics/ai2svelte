ai2svelte provides an event system that lets you respond to component lifecycle events and state changes. Use these events to create dynamic, interactive experiences that react to user interactions and component updates.

### onAiMounted

Fired when your ai2svelte component has fully loaded and is ready for interaction. This event is perfect for initializing additional functionality, setting up third-party integrations, or performing actions that require the component to be completely rendered.

```svelte
<script>
	function handleAiMounted() {
	  console.log("ai2svelte component has been mounted");
	}
</script>

<MyComponent assetsPath={assets || '/'} onAiMounted="{handleAiMounted}" />
```

### onArtboardChange

Triggers whenever the active artboard changes. Since ai2svelte uses container queries, all the artboards are added to the DOM on initial load. `onArtboardChange` can be useful when you want to target elements with same CSS selector across multiple artboards.

```svelte
<script>
	function handleArtboardChange(artboard) {
	  // artboard is the newly active artboard element
	  console.log("Active artboard has changed:", artboard);

	  // perform object fetching or other actions based on the new artboard
	  const POIs = artboard.querySelector(".PointOfInterest");
	}
</script>

<MyComponent assetsPath={assets || '/'} onArtboardChange="{handleArtboardChange}" />
```
