## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Why isn't the Identifier field updating when I select elements?</summary>

If the Identifier field in the ai2svelte panel doesn't change when you select different elements in your Illustrator document, the issue is likely with the AiHostAdapter plugin installation.

**Solution:** Verify that you've correctly installed the AiHostAdapter.aip file in the proper location. Check our [Auto-detect selectors guide](../auto-detect/) for detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting steps.

<details>
<summary>Why does the Identifier only show the parent layer instead of child elements?</summary>

This is a limitation of how Illustrator handles single-element layers. When a layer contains only one element, Illustrator treats the element and its parent layer as the same object.

**Solution:**
To correctly identify child elements, ensure you have more than one element within the layer. Illustrator can't distinguish between a single element and its parent layer. Always rename the elements that you want to stylise to identify them correctly.

## Layer Organization

<details>
<summary>Do I need separate tagged layers for each artboard?</summary>

**No!** ai2svelte is smart enough to handle multiple artboards within a single tagged layer, which can significantly simplify your workflow.

**Best practices:**

- Use one tagged layer that spans across all artboards you want to export
- Organize elements logically within the layer structure for easier identification
- This approach reduces complexity while maintaining full styling control

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why can't I style elements in non-tagged layers?</summary>

ai2svelte only exports and makes available elements that are within tagged layers. Elements in non-tagged layers are treated as background content and aren't individually accessible for styling.

**Solution:** Move any elements you want to style into a properly tagged layer:

- **`:svg`** for vector graphics that need to scale and be styled with CSS
- **`:png`** for raster images and complex graphics that should remain as images

This tagging system ensures optimal performance and gives you precise control over which elements can be customized.

## Performance Optimization

<details>
<summary>How can I optimize loading speed for above-the-fold hero graphics?</summary>

For critical graphics that users see immediately (like hero images), you can prioritize their loading to improve perceived performance.

**Solution:** Add `priority_fetch: true` to your ai2svelte configuration:

```yaml
// ... other settings
priority_fetch: true
```

**⚠️ Important:** Only use `priority_fetch` for truly critical, above-the-fold content. Overusing this setting can actually slow down your overall page performance by competing for bandwidth with other essential resources.

**Best for:** Hero images, key visual elements, essential UI components visible on initial page load.
