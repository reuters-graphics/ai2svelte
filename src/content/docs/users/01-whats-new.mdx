## v1.0.0 - Complete Redesign

This major release represents a comprehensive redesign of ai2svelte, delivering significant improvements to both functionality and user experience. Key enhancements include:

### Interface & Workflow

- **Visual UI Interface**: Upgraded from an executable script to an intuitive, visual panel-based interface
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Streamlined workflow with improved accessibility and ease of use

### Design & Styling

- **Expanded Visual Effects**: Access to a comprehensive library of pre-defined shadows and animations
- **Improved Layer Management**: Layer ordering now accurately reflects the stacking context from Adobe Illustrator

- **Batched Exports**: Export multiple svelte files from a single Illustrator document
- **Style Code Editor**: Write and customize SCSS styles directly within the ai2svelte panel
- **Priority Image Fetching**: Set `priority_fetch:true` for critical above-the-fold images to enhance loading performance
- **Profiles**: Save and load different export settings for various projects or workflows
- **Templates**: Create and use custom templates for consistent project structure and styling
- **Font Management**: Easy mapping of fonts between Adobe Illustrator and CSS
