ai2svelte began as a fork of ai2html v0.123.1, with all New York Times-specific code removed to make the project fully generic and open for the community.

You can find the project repository on GitHub: [ai2svelte](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/ai2svelte/).

We welcome contributions of all kinds! You can help by:

- Reporting bugs or issues
- Suggesting new features or improvements
- Submitting pull requests for code, documentation, or tests
- Reviewing and discussing open issues

Check out the [issues page](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/ai2svelte/issues) to find something to work on, or to propose new ideas. Every contribution, big or small, helps make ai2svelte better for everyone.
